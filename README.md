# MackilohaGUI
Very basic ImGUI app for working with Mackiloha. Currently Linux only at the moment, I want more platform support but I don't have the hardware and abilty.

 # Goals
* Arkhelper - 2/3 functions done
* Superfreq - TODO
* P9SongTool - TODO
* Grim support - eventually but not primary focus.
* Console output window

# Issues
App freezes when running a tool.
Code looks messy.
